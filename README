** Changes/New Features

Version 0.6-9:

	* New arguments for calibrateDepth(), offering improved control
	  over detection of descent, bottom, and ascent phases.  We now
	  use rates of vertical movement for detection, with a further
	  argument for defining what determines a bottom wiggle.

	* New arguments for plotDive() to decide whether to plot legend
          and to set limits for depth plot.

	* Documentation for formal classes and methods was split to make
          them easier to read.


* Overview
==========

Dive analysis usually involves handling of large amounts of data, as new
instruments allow for frequent sampling of variables over long periods of
time.  The aim of this package is to make this process more efficient for
summarizing and extracting information gathered by time-depth recorders
(TDRs, hereafter).  The principal motivation for developing diveMove was
to provide more flexibility during the various stages of analysis than is
available in popular commercial software.  This is achieved by making the
results from intermediate calculations easily accessible, allowing the
user to make his/her own summaries beyond the default choices the package
provides.
