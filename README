** Changes/New Features

*** Version 0.9.6:

        * Fixed .cutDive() to behave as intended: wiggles above wiggle.tol
	  should not be allowed to terminate descent phase.

	* Better documentation explaining the basics of dive phase
	  detection.

*** Version 0.9.5:

        * Documentation fixes in preparation for new release.  New parser
          has more strict rules for syntax.

*** Version 0.9.4:

        * More helpful help pages, particularly in readTDR(), to indicate
          that problems in input text files are better dealt with outside
          GNU R.

	* Vignette now includes introduction to the bout detection
          functions.

*** Version 0.9.3:

        * Fixed bug that avoided vignette to be built.

*** Version 0.9.2:

        * New vignette now builds up on R News article.

	* Fixed bug in diveStats() so that a warning regarding duplicate
          row.names is no longer given.

*** Version 0.9.1:

        * Use the 'grid' manager rather than 'pack', and rearrange widgets
	  for a better fit in plotTD().

*** Version 0.9.0:

        * Minor package-building improvements.

*** Version 0.8.9:

        * Fixed bug in rmsDistFilter() causing the filter to fail with
          very small data sets with message warning that window size is
          larger than available data, because locations at ends were not
          being counted.

*** Version 0.8.8:

        * The root-mean-square filter in rmsDistFilter() now works as
          described in Freitas et al. (2008), rather than as in the
          original McConnell et al. (1992).  The latter may not have been
          the actual implementation, although other studies may have
          followed it (e.g. Austin et al. 2003).

*** Version 0.8.7:

        * Fixed citations in *.Rd files and CITATION.

*** Version 0.8.6:

        * Fixed bug in grpSpeedFilter() whereby the test to fail if any
          speed > threshold, rather than if ALL speeds > threshold.

*** Version 0.8.5:

	* Improved validity check for input in distFilter().

*** Version 0.8.4:

	* Fixed bug in rmsDistfilter() to intercept an error due to the
	  number of rows being exactly equal to the test window size.  The
	  dimensions of internal objects are now handled properly.

*** Version 0.8.3:

	* Better explanation of location filtering procedures in man
          pages.

*** Version 0.8.0:

	* New methods for identification and analysis of bouts of
          behaviour (mostly diving, but apply to others too).

*** Version 0.7-8:

        * Better arrangement of widgets in plotTD() and its methods.

*** Version 0.7-7:

	* S4 documentation bug fix.

*** Version 0.7-6:

    	* Fixes bug in plotTD() to work with stricter object class
          management in R devel.

*** Version 0.7-5:

	* Full examples for movement functions.

*** Version 0.7-4:

	* distSpeed() no longer uses 'id' argument.

	* Complete examples for location filtering functions.

	* createTDR() now provides useful default for 'concurrentData',
          and test for missing 'dtime'.  Completed example accordingly.

	* Improved show() method for 'TDRcalibrate' objects.

	* plotTD(), and hence the plotTDR() methods now accept an ellipsis
          argument to pass to par() for more flexibility drawing the plot.
          They also now accept a new argument 'cex.pts' to set the
          relative size of points.

*** Version 0.7-3:

	* detPhase() and detDive() are now private functions (renamed with
          a preceding dot), and should only be used through
          calibrateDepth().

	* Rearranged documentation, reflecting the higher importance of
          calibrateDepth() and calibrateSpeed() functions.

	* distSpeed() no longer uses 'speed' and 'subset' arguments, and
          always returns a matrix.  All location filtering functions are
          now adapted to this change.

*** Version 0.7-2:

	* More examples for important functions.

*** Version 0.7-1:

	* 'TDRcalibrate' method for plot() now plots correctly if no dives
          were identified.  New argument 'interact' to allow for static
          plots, without 'tcltk' interaction.

	* plot method replaced by 'plotTDR', to avoid unusual introduction
          of arguments in methods and simplify code.  This method is now
          based on the new function plotTD(), which replaces plotDive().
          This system now makes the relationships between functions much
          more clear.

	* Function getAct() renamed to rleActivity() to make it clearer
          that it calculates statistics from running series of readings
          with the same activity.

*** Version 0.7-0:

	* Arguments 'seaerr', 'landerr', and 'divethres' were renamed to
          'wet.thr', 'dry.thr', and 'dive.thr'.  Likewise, slots
          'land.threshold', 'sea.threshold', and 'dive.threshold' in class
          TDRcalibrate were renamed to 'dry.thr', 'wet.thr', and
          'dive.thr', respectively, for consistency/appropriateness.

	* The argument 'contours' to rqPlot() should now be a list with 2
          components.

*** Version 0.6-9:

	* New arguments for calibrateDepth(), offering improved control
	  over detection of descent, bottom, and ascent phases.  We now
	  use rates of vertical movement for detection, with a further
	  argument for defining what determines a bottom wiggle.

	* New arguments for plotDive() to decide whether to plot legend
          and to set limits for depth plot.

	* Documentation for formal classes and methods was split to make
          them easier to read.

	* attendance() has been renamed to timeBudget().


* Overview
==========

Dive analysis usually involves handling of large amounts of data, as new
instruments allow for frequent sampling of variables over long periods of
time.  The aim of this package is to make this process more efficient for
summarizing and extracting information gathered by time-depth recorders
(TDRs, hereafter).  The principal motivation for developing diveMove was
to provide more flexibility during the various stages of analysis than is
available in popular commercial software.  This is achieved by making the
results from intermediate calculations easily accessible, allowing the
user to make his/her own summaries beyond the default choices the package
provides.
