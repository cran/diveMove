Dive and movement analyses and plots			      -*-outline-*-
====================================

Set of functions to analyse time-depth recorder and location data.

Read ?diveMove for a quick overview of the major functionality.  A
vignette is also available by doing vignette("diveMove").


* Overview
==========

Dive analysis usually involves handling of large amounts of data, as new
instruments allow for frequent sampling of variables over long periods of
time.  The aim of this package is to make this process more efficient for
summarizing and extracting information gathered by time-depth recorders
(TDRs, hereafter).  The principal motivation for developing diveMove was
to provide more flexibility during the various stages of analysis than is
available in popular commercial software.  This is achieved by making the
results from intermediate calculations easily accessible, allowing the
user to make his/her own summaries beyond the default choices the package
provides.
