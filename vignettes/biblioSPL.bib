	nursed for about 3 weeks. Weaning mass of pups is highly variable,
	some pups are born 3 times as heavy as others at weaning. After weaning
	pups fast for several weeks. Pup weaning mass was positively related
	to maternal postpartum mass, which accounted for 55\% of the variation
	in weaning mass. Male pups are heavier than female pups at weaning,
	but this difference dissapeared after maternal mass was controlled
	for. After fasting, weaned pups went to sea at an average of 68\%
	of weaning mass. Heavier pups remained on the beach longer after
	weaning than lighter pups. Only male pups took part in mock fights.
	With increasing age, pups spent more time in the water. Mortality
	during the postweaning fast was negligible (0.1\%). The timing of
	departure to sea may involve a trade-off between early departure
	with greater fat stores but poorer foraging abilities and a late
	departure with increased foraging and social skills but with reduced

  abstract = {We studied a black lemur population over a 2-year period (1992-1993)
	and 8 years later (2000) in a 50-ha secondary forest in northwest
	Madagascar. All of the animals were marked to investigate population
	dynamics and seasonal variation in ranging and behavior, and new
	data on black lemurs were obtained. Our data on demographic characteristics
	were expanded to include other forest sites and contrasted with those
	collected in other Eulemur macaco macaco field studies, in relation
	to human activity and the presence of introduced and cultivated plant
	species. Density is affected by deforestation and hunting. Group
	size and home range depend on the composition of the forest and probably
	food patches. Sex ratio at birth varies according to the number of
	females per group, a result that fits the local resource competition
	model. Groups are multimale-multifemale, and adult females form the
	core of the groups. Reproductive parameters indicate sharply defined
	seasonal breeding, a high female reproductive rate, and birth synchrony.
	Changes in group composition reveal male and female juvenile dispersal,
	male transfer between groups at the time of mating, and adult female
	transfer and group fission when groups exceed a critical size. At
	mating and birth, intergroup agonistic encounters occurred at home-range
	boundaries, and larger groups were dominant over smaller groups.
	Patterns of intragroup interactions suggest that males compete for
	access to groups of females during the mating season, and that females
	may compete for food resources during the birth season. Our study
	also reports female social dominance and lack of sexual weight dimorphism
	in this species.},

  abstract = {The reproductive pattern of pinnipeds is characterised by embryonic
	diapause, annual reproduction, and synchronous breeding cycles. Active
	gestation lasts about 8 months in most species, but the duration
	of embryonic diapause varies indirectly with the length of the postpartum
	oestrous cycle. Data on reproductive endocrinology are limited to
	a few species, owing to the difficulties involved in obtaining serial
	samples from individuals. The postpartum oestrus is marked by elevated
	oestradiol concentrations followed by a rise in progesterone levels
	after ovulation. An infertile cycle may lead to pseudopregnancy,
	although on rare occasions there may a further period of oestrus.
	Progesterone concentrations remain elevated for the duration of pregnancy
	and chorionic gonadotrophin concentration in the placenta increases
	early in postimplatation. Sex steroids do not appear to be directly
	involved in blastocyst reactivation. The environmental factors influencing
	implantation appear to be the most significant proximate factors
	in timing pinniped reproductive cycles. In most species, implantation
	occurs when day length is declining, and a photoperiod of about 12
	h may provide the signal for implantation in some species. Other
	proximate factors may include sea temperature, at least for grey
	seals. Pinnipeds have reproductive cycles with an active and an inactive
	phase. The inactive phase may be equivalent to the period of embryonic
	diapause. Transition from the inactive to the active phase and reactivation
	of embryonic growth are probably controlled by the same environmental
	cues.},

	mass was used to calculate the mean energetic cost of producing a
	pup to parturition. The cost for male pup was always higher than
	the cost for a female pup. Given the probable pattern of foetal growth,
	this constitutes a minimum of 5-15\% of the maternal energy budget
	in the final months of gestation. Birth mass varied inversely with
	date of birth, but more strongly for male than for female pups. The
	sex ratio was unity in both years and it did not vary with time through
	the birth season. In a subsample, there was a decline in the body
	mass and standard length with date of birth. Male birth masswas directly
	related to maternal mass and condition (mass/length) but there was
	no significant relationship for females. These results suggest that
	the growth of male foetuses is limited by maternal resources while
	female foetuses do not exploit fully maternal resources.},

	Great-winged Pterodroma macroptera, White-chinned Procellaria aequinoctialis
	and Grey Petrels Proceharia cinerea have been studied at Kerguelen
	and Crozet Islands. The White-headed Petrel (summer breeder) followed
	an essentially biennial cycle with only 13% of successful individuals
	breeding again the next year. On the other hand, the Great-winged
	Petrel (winter breeder) was mainly an annual breeder with 78% of
	successful birds breeding again the next year. Both White-chinned
	(summer breeder) and Grey Petrels (winter breeder) showed a higher
	breeding frequency than Pterodroma species, with 91% and 93%, respectively,
	of successful birds returning to breed the following season. These
	contrasting patterns may be related to the timing of energetic constraints
	encountered during the interbreeding period, principally the moult
	and the restoration of breeding condition. It is suggested that these
	post-breeding constraints are more marked in winter and in oceanic
	waters, leading to breeding frequencies being lower than in summer
	and in neritic waters. The intermediate patterns of breeding frequency
	found in the Great-winged Petrel (mainly annual) and the White-headed
	Petrel (mainly biennial) show that among Procellariiformes there
	is a continuum between annual and strictly biennial species.},

  abstract = {1. We discuss aspects of resource selection based on observing a given
	vector of resource variables for different individuals at discrete
	time steps. A new technique for estimating preference of habitat
	characteristics, applicable when there are multiple individual observations,
	is proposed. 2. We first show how to estimate preference on the population
	and individual level when only a single site- or resource component
	is observed. A variance component model based on normal scores in
	used to estimate mean preference for the population as well as the
	heterogeneity among individuals defined by the intra-class correlation.
	3. Next, a general technique is proposed for time series of observations
	of a vector with several components, correcting for the effect of
	correlations between these. The preference of each single component
	is analyzed under the assumption of arbitrarily complex selection
	of the other components. This approach is based on the theory for
	conditional distributions in the multi-normal model. 4. The method
	is demonstrated using a data set of radio-tagged dispersing juvenile
	goshawks and their site characteristics, and can be used as a general
	tool in resource or habitat selection analysis.},

	protein during lactation},
  journal = {Physiol Zool},
  year = {1995},
  volume = {69},
  pages = {887-951},
  abstract = {Pregnant female southern elephant seals vary in size by more than
	a factor of 3 when they come ashore to give birth and nurse their
	pups. Pups are fed exclusively from the mother's body stores, which
	vary in proportion to her mass at parturition. We measured the use
	of body materials and energy over the course of lactation using a
	combination of isotope dilution and mass change during 4 breeding
	seasons on South Georgia. On average, mothers lost 35\% of their
	mass at parturition during lactation. This included approx. 52\%
	of the energy, 61\% of the fat, and 24\% of the protein in the mother's
	body. The relative amount that mothers expend on their pups is highly
	variable and shows little consistent trend with the mother's mass.
	Some large mothers used approx. 30\% of their stored energy (comprising
	about 40\% of stored fat, and 20\% of body protein) to produce medium
	to large sized pups. Whereas some smaller mothers produced only small
	pups, others used all of or more than the reserves estimated to be
	available without incurring in deleterious effects (68\% of energy,
	80\% of fat, and 27\% of protein). These small animals may be at
	risk of compromising their future reproduction. The reproduction
	of small pups by these smaller females may reflect a compromise between

	model of alcohol consumption and HIV disease progression over time},

  year = {2007},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {8},
  abstract = {Longitudinal studies are helpful in understanding how subtle associations
	between factors of interest change over time. Our goal is to apply
	statistical methods which are appropriate for analyzing longitudinal
	data to a repeated measures epidemiological study as a tutorial in
	the appropriate use and interpretation of random effects models.
	To motivate their use, we study the association of alcohol consumption
	on markers of HIV disease progression in an observational cohort.
	To make valid inferences, the association among measurements correlated
	within a subject must be taken into account.We describe a linear
	mixed effects regression framework that accounts for the clustering
	of longitudinal data and that can be fit using standard statistical
	software. We apply the linear mixed effects model to a previously
	published dataset of HIV infected individuals with a history of alcohol
	problems who are receiving HAART (n = 197). The researchers were
	interested in determining the effect of alcohol use on HIV disease
	progression over time. Fitting a linear mixed effects multiple regression
	model with a random intercept and random slope for each subject accounts
	for the association of observations within subjects and yields parameters
	interpretable as in ordinary multiple regression. A significant interaction
	between alcohol use and adherence to HAART is found: subjects who
	use alcohol and are not fully adherent to their HIV medications had
	higher log RNA (ribonucleic acid) viral load levels than fully adherent
	non-drinkers, fully adherent alcohol users, and non-drinkers who
	were not fully adherent.Longitudinal studies are increasingly common
	in epidemiological research. Software routines that account for correlation
	between repeated measures using linear mixed effects methods are
	now generally available and straightforward to utilize. These models
	allow the relaxation of assumptions needed for approaches such as
	repeated measures ANOVA, and should be routinely incorporated into
	the analysis of cohort studies.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Foraging behaviours of the Australian sea lion (Neophoca
	cinerea) reflect an animal working hard to exploit benthic habitats.
	Lactating females demonstrate almost continuous diving, maximize
	bottom time, exhibit elevated field metabolism and frequently exceed
	their calculated aerobic dive limit. Given that larger animals have
	disproportionately greater diving capabilities, we wanted to examine
	how pups and juveniles forage successfully. 2. Time/depth recorders
	were deployed on pups, juveniles and adult females at Seal Bay Conservation
	Park, Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Ten different mother/pup
	pairs were equipped at three stages of development (6, 15 and 23
	months) to record the diving behaviours of 51 (nine instruments failed)
	animals. 3. Dive depth and duration increased with age. However,
	development was slow. At 6 months, pups demonstrated minimal diving
	activity and the mean depth for 23-month-old juveniles was only 44
	+- 4 m, or 62% of adult mean depth. 4. Although pups and juveniles
	did not reach adult depths or durations, dive records for young sea
	lions indicate benthic diving with mean bottom times (2.0 +- 0.2
	min) similar to those of females (2.1 +- 0.2 min). This was accomplished
	by spending higher proportions of each dive and total time at sea
	on or near the bottom than adults. Immature sea lions also spent
	a higher percentage of time at sea diving. 5. Juveniles may have
	to work harder because they are weaned before reaching full diving
	capability. For benthic foragers, reduced diving ability limits available
	foraging habitat. Furthermore, as juveniles appear to operate close
	to their physiological maximum, they would have a difficult time
	increasing foraging effort in response to reductions in prey. Although
	benthic prey are less influenced by seasonal fluctuations and oceanographic
	perturbations than epipelagic prey, demersal fishery trawls may impact
	juvenile survival by disrupting habitat and removing larger size
	classes of prey. These issues may be an important factor as to why
	the Australian sea lion population is currently at risk. Journal

  abstract = {A survey of the temporal pattern of population structure and feeding
	activity of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae was conducted for the first
	time in two host species colonies: King penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus
	halli) and Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus chrysolophus).
	The life cycle of the tick was investigated over 3 years in a King
	penguin colony and 2 years in a Macaroni penguin colony at Possession
	Island (Crozet Archipelago). There was a marked seasonal feeding
	activity pattern of ticks in both host species, connected with the
	presence of birds during the breeding season. Although the King penguin
	colonies were occupied throughout the year by birds, the favourable
	period for engorgement was limited to 3.5-4.5 months, and almost
	all the ticks overwintered in the unengorged state. Consequently,
	I. uriae probably completed its life cycle over 3 years in King penguin
	colonies. In contrast, this life cycle could be shortened to 2 years
	in Macaroni penguin colonies, as a result of a different timetable
	of the presence of birds for breeding and moulting. The relationships
	between such plasticity and the host behaviour and subantarctic climatic
	conditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the effects of habitat on the diet, population
	density, and social structure of a small-bodied folivore, Hapalemur
	griseus. Three groups of H. griseus were followed at two study sites
	(Tala and Vato) within Ranomafana National Park in southeastern Madagascar.
	These two sites differed in degree of habitat disturbance, forest
	composition, and forest structure, as determined by botanical plots
	(50 x 10 m) which were monitored twice monthly in the home ranges
	of three study groups (group T, n = 4; group V1, n = 4; group V2,
	n = 2). Tala has experienced more habitat disturbance compared to
	Vato, and this appeared to influence population density and group
	size. The H. griseus that inhabit Tala occur at much higher densities
	and in larger social groups than the H. griseus at Vato. These results
	may be attributable to: 1) a greater number of potential food sources,
	2) a more dense resource base, and/or 3) higher-quality resources
	at Tala for this folivore. In general, dietary diversity for all
	groups was low, and groups exploited similar plant species. However,
	within this small range of food sources, each study group specialized
	in food sources found in the highest abundance within their home
	range. This resulted in dietary differences between groups within
	sites, as well as differences between sites. Introduced tree species
	such as Chinese guava (Psidium cattleyanum) may have greatly impacted
	the diet and social structure of those groups at Tala, whose home
	ranges included this food source. In contrast, Vato group 1 ingested
	more new and mature leaves of Ficus spp., and Vato group 2 primarily
	ate spider bamboo (Nastus elongatus). In conclusion, it seems that
	microhabitat differences, which may be related to habitat disturbance

	requirements alone can explain how population density decreases,

	a general mechanistic model that predicts the frequency of interaction,

	evidence supports the model, demonstrating that spatial constraints
	on defense cause exclusivity of home range use to decrease with increasing
	body size. In large mammals, over 90\% of available resources may
	be lost to neighbors. Our model offers a general framework to understand

	A. gazella pups at Marion Island were weighed frequently until weaning,

	Island is faster than at South Georgia, indicating that conditions

	for pup growth. The decrease in A. tropicalis pup body weight in
	July/August may result from either a scarity of food in winter or
	weaning having been initiated. The two groups (polar and non-polar)
	of fur seals exhibit two strategies, which include differences in
	pup growth and suckling period; the polar species have a short suckling
	period and rapid pup growth and are predominantly pelagic over winter,

  abstract = {Although growth and mass at weaning were highly correlated, they were
	not related to maternal characteristics in both study years. However
	in 1990 there was a negative relationship between growth of pups
	and mean duration of foraging trips. Growth rates of males and females
	varied considerably between 1972 and 1991 and appeared to decline
	from 1984 through 1990. Methods used to collect and weigh the pups
	influenced the nature and magnitude of sex differences in estimated
	growth rates. Growth rates of male and female pups did not differ
	when weighed serially, but males grew faster than females when weighed
	cross-sectionally. Based on our results of pairs of mothers and pups
	followed over the lactation period, maternal investment was greater
	in males than females because males were heavier at birth and older
	at weaning than females and not because of any differential growth
	between sexes. Mothers appear to have to work longer, but not harder,
	to wean males than females. Under the favorable feeding conditions
	that usually exist, individual differences in the growth of pups
	are most likely influences by variation in foraging efficiency of
	mothers.},

  abstract = {Harp seals give birth on pack ice and nurse their pups for about 13
	d. We hypothesized that lactating females would transfer milk and
	energy to pups at a high rate to compensate for the brevity of lactation.
	To test this hypothesis, the milk intake of 5 pups was measured over
	6-8 d period after administration of deuterium oxide; the initial
	age of pups was estimated to range from 0-5 days postpartum. Body
	water content of 17 pups was also measured by isotope dilution, and
	body composition of 12 pups was determined by chemical analysis.
	The proximate composition of harp seal milk (n=21) was also assayed.
	Harp seal pups contained little fat (3\%) at birth, but 61\% of the
	increase in body mass (average 2.3 Kg/d) was fat, with the result
	that fat accounted for 47\% of body mass at weaning. Body water estimated
	by isotope dilution was not significantly different from that measured
	directly (n=9 paired samples); water composed 72\% of lean body mass.
	From birth to weaning, milk lipid increased from 36\% to 57\%, and
	milk water declined from 51\% to 32\%. Pup milk intake averaged 3.7
	Kg/d. Mass gain of pups was highly correlated with both milk intake
	and energy intake. The rate of energy output by mothers is higher
	than that measured in most other phocids. Daily energy output is
	inversely related to lactation duration in phocids; a polynomial
	regression relating energy output to lactation duration explained
	99\% of the interspecific variation.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the status of White Whales (Delphinapterus leucas
	) in two areas bordering northern Quebec: Ungava Bay and eastern
	Hudson Bay. The whales occupying southern Ungava Bay and eastern
	Hudson Bay in summer are taken to be separate management stocks.
	Recent aerial surveys have shown that the number of whales summering
	in southern Ungava Bay is only a few tens of individuals, compared
	with at least 800-1000 in the 1870s. Numbers estimated at more than
	1500 are present during the summer in traditionally-occupied areas
	along the Eastmain, where there were at least 6600 animals in the
	1850s. Both stocks continue to be hunted, although since 1986 community
	quotas have been set and hunting has been banned at the Marralik
	River of southern Ungava Bay. The Ungava Bay stock is clearly endangered,
	and any further harvesting will delay or prevent its recovery. The
	Eastmain stock may be able to sustain continued harvesting. However,
	there are at least four reasons for concern about its status. We
	therefore recommend that the Eastmain stock be classified as threatened.},

	storage roles are especially important in allowing the animals to
	survive food shortages and stresses associated with competition for
	mates, territorial defense, gestation and lactation, and to accomplish
	migrations. The composition, cellularity and anatomical site of adipose
	depots in a mammal can influence both the amount of fat stored and
	its availability and usefulness in any given situation. The fatty
	acids and complex lipids in adipose tissue, blood vessels, nerves
	and brain change in response to ambient temperature and the low body
	temperatures during hibernation. Early nutrition may influence the
	number of fat cells developed by a mammal, and thus affect its ability
	to survive adversity. Desert species develop localized depots which
	will not interfere with temperature regulation, while animals in
	cold environments use their extensive superficial fat layers as insulation.},
